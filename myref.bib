	detector operates at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN.  It was
	conceived to study proton-proton (and lead-lead) collisions at a
	centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV (5.5 TeV nucleon-nucleon) and at
	luminosities up to 1034 cm−2 s−1 (1027 cm−2 s−1).  At the core of the CMS detector sits a
	high-magnetic-field and large-bore superconducting solenoid
	surrounding an all-silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead-tungstate
	scintillating-crystals electromagnetic calorimeter, and a
	brass-scintillator sampling hadron calorimeter.  The iron yoke of the
	flux-return is instrumented with four stations of muon detectors
	covering most of the 4π solid angle.  Forward sampling
	calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage to high values
	(|η| ⩽ 5) assuring very good hermeticity.  The overall
	dimensions of the CMS detector are a length of 21.6 m, a diameter of
	14.6 m and a total weight of 12500 t.}

SketchUp provides a Ruby API which we use to interface with the CMS Detector Description to create 3D models of the CMS detector. With the Ruby API, we also have created an interface to the JSON-based event format used for the iSpy event display to create 3D models of CMS events. These models have many applications related to 3D representation of the CMS detector and events. Figures produced based on these models were used in conference presentations, journal publications, technical design reports for the detector upgrades, art projects, outreach programs, and other presentations.}
