\section{The Standard Model}

The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is a Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory (QFT) that describes the dynamics of elementary particles.  Three critical developments leading to the formation of the SM, as described by Steven Weinberg\cite{Weinberg:2004kv}, were the quark model proposed by Gell-Mann\cite{GellMann:1964nj} and Zweig\cite{Zweig:1964jf} in 1964, the idea of gauge symmetry by Yang and Mills\cite{Yang:1954ek} in 1954, and the notion of spontaneous symmetry breaking proposed by Goldstone\cite{Goldstone:1961eq} in 1961.  This ultimately led to the SM in its current form as a non-Abelian gauge theory with the symmetry group
\begin{equation}
	\label{equation:gaugesymmetry}
	G_{SM} = SU(3)_C \otimes SU(2)_L \otimes U(1)_Y
\end{equation}
where $SU(3)_C$ is responsible for strong interactions and $SU(2)_L \otimes U(1)_Y$ is responsible for unified electromagnetic and weak interactions, also known as electroweak interactions.

Associated with each of these symmetry groups is a set of massless spin-1 vector fields called gauge bosons.  These are listed in Table \ref{table:BosonFields} along with the associated charge or generator for that group.  There are eight such gauge bosons in $SU(3)_C$ called gluons $G_\mu^{1,...,8}$.  There are three gauge bosons $W_\mu^{1,2,3}$ in $SU(2)_L$ and one gauge boson $B_\mu$ in $U(1)_Y$.  The gauge bosons mediate the interactions between spin-1/2 fields $\psi$ called fermions.  At this point it's worth noting that the $W$ and $B$ gauge fields are not observable bosons, but are mixed by electroweak symmestry breaking to produce observable bosons.  The details of this will be covered in Section \ref{section:EWSB}.

There are twelve fermion fields which can be split into six lepton fields and six quark fields.  Both quarks and leptons are comprised of three generations.  For quarks there are three "up-type" quarks (up $u$, charm $c$, and top $t$) and three "down-type" quarks (down $d$, strange $s$, and bottom $b$).  The lepton fields are electron $e$, muon $\mu$, tau $\tau$, and three neutrino fields $\nu_e$, $\nu_\mu$, and $\nu_\tau$.  The fermion fields and their representations under $G_{SM}$ are listed in Table \ref{table:FermionTable}.  Each fermion field can be expressed in terms of left and right chirality fields, which are represented by a doublets $\psi_L$ in the left-handed case and singlets $\psi_R$ in the right-handed case with
\
\begin{eqnarray}
	\psi = \psi_R + \psi_L \\
	\psi_R = \frac{1}{2}(1+\gamma^5)\psi \\
	\psi_L = \frac{1}{2}(1-\gamma^5)\psi  
\end{eqnarray}

The SM also contains a complex scalar doublet field $\phi$ called the Higgs field in honor of Peter Higgs, who was among one of the physicists who proposed its existence in 1964 \cite{Higgs:1964pj}.

The strong interaction is described by the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD).  The Lagrangian for the QCD interaction can be written as
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L}_{QCD} = \bar{\psi}(i\gamma^\mu D_\mu -m)\psi - \frac{1}{2}TrG_{\mu \nu}G^{\mu \nu}
	\label{equation:qcdlagrangian}
\end{equation}
where  
\begin{eqnarray}
	G_{\mu \nu} = \partial_\mu G_\nu - \partial_\nu G_\mu - ig_s[G_\mu , G_\nu] \\
	D_\mu = \partial_\mu - ig_sG_\mu
\end{eqnarray}
$g_s$ is related to the strong coupling constant, and $m$ is the fermion mass, which in this case must be a quark since they are the only fermions with color charge.

\section{Electroweak Symmetry Breaking} \label{section:EWSB}
A crucial feature of the SM is electroweak symmetry breaking.  The electroweak interaction, first proposed by Glashow, Weinberg, and Salam in the 60's, is the unified description of electromagnetic and weak interactions under the $SU(2)_L \otimes U(1)_Y$ symmetry.  The electromagnetic interaction is described by quantum electrodynamics (QED), which is an Abelian gauge theory under the $U(1)_{EM}$ symmetry group.  The gauge boson in QED is the photon and couples to electric charge $Q$. The QED Lagrangian is given by
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L}_{QED} = \bar{\psi}(i\gamma^\mu D_\mu -m)\psi - \frac{1}{4}F_{\mu \nu}F^{\mu \nu}
	\label{equation:qedlagrangian}
\end{equation}
where   
\begin{eqnarray}
	F_{\mu \nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu \\
	D_\mu = \partial_\mu + ieQA_\mu
\end{eqnarray}
and $A_\mu$ is the electromagnetic or photon field.

The Lagrangian for the unbroken $SU(2)_L \otimes U(1)_Y$ symmetry is given by
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L}_{EW} = \bar{\psi}i\gamma^\mu D_\mu \psi - Tr\frac{1}{8}W_{\mu \nu}W^{\mu \nu} - \frac{1}{4}B_{\mu \nu}B^{\mu \nu}
	\label{equation:ewlagrangian}
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{eqnarray}
	W_{\mu \nu} = \partial_\mu W_\nu - \partial_\nu W_\mu - ig_w[W_\mu , W_\nu] \\
	B_{\mu \nu} = \partial_\mu B_\nu - \partial_\nu B_\mu
\end{eqnarray}
with a separate fermion term for each field $\psi_R$ and $\psi_L$.  The covariant derivative $D_\mu$ is given by 
\begin{equation}
	D_\mu = \partial_\mu + ig_wT_iW_\mu^i + ig_Y \frac{Y}{2}B_\mu
\end{equation}
with $W_\mu^i$ and $T_i$ written in terms of raising and lowering operators 
\begin{eqnarray}
	W_\mu^\pm = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(W_\mu^1\mp W_\mu^2) \\
	T^\pm = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(T_1 \pm T_2) \\
	W_\mu^0 = W_\mu^3 \\
	T^0 = T_3
\end{eqnarray}
The neutral portion of the covariant derivative $ig_wT_3W_\mu^3 + ig_Y \frac{Y}{2}B_\mu $must contain the electromagnetic term $ieAQ$ for the electromagnetic interaction to be unified with the weak interaction, so the $W_\mu^3$ and $B_\mu$ fields need to linear combinations of the photon field $A_\mu$ and another field $Z_\mu$.  This relationship can be written in terms of the electroweak mixing angle $\theta_w$, also known as the Weinberg angle, as 
\begin{equation}
	\left(
	\begin{array}{c}
		A_\mu \\
		Z_\mu \\
	\end{array}
	\right)
	=
	\left(
	\begin{array}{cc}
		\cos\theta_W & \sin\theta_W \\
		-\sin\theta_W & \cos\theta_W
	\end{array}
	\right)
	\left(
	\begin{array}{c}
		B_\mu \\
		W_\mu^3 \\
	\end{array}
	\right)
\end{equation}
The weak isospin $T_3$ and weak hypercharge $Y$ can be related to the electric charge $Q$ with the Gell-Mann-Nishijima formula
\begin{equation}
	Y = 2(Q-T_3)
\end{equation}
and the coupling constants $g_w$, $g_Y$, and $e$ are related to the mixing angle by
\begin{eqnarray}
	e = g_w\cos\theta_W = g_Y\sin\theta_W \\
	\sin\theta_W = \frac{g_Y}{\sqrt{g_w^2 + g_Y^2}} \\
	\cos\theta_W = \frac{g_w}{\sqrt{g_w^2 + g_Y^2}}
\end{eqnarray}
At this point the $W_\mu^{1,2,3}$ and $B_\mu$ fields have been mixed to produce the observable fields $W_\mu^+$, $W_\mu^-$, $A_\mu$, and $Z_\mu$, but this is still inconsistent with experimental observations as these bosons and all of the fermions are still massless in this model.  In order to generate the masses while maintaining the renormalizability of the gauge theory the symmetry needs to be spontaneously broken.  This is done by the introduction of a complex scalar doublet field called the Higgs field which is expressed as
\begin{equation}
	\phi = 
	\left(
	\begin{array}{c}
		\phi^+ \\
		\phi^0
	\end{array}
	\right) = 
	\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(
	\begin{array}{c}
		\phi_1 + i\phi_2 \\
		\phi_3 + i\phi_4 
	\end{array}
	\right)
\end{equation}
where the fields $\phi_i$ are real scalar fields.  
The Lagrangian for the Higgs field is
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L}_{Hiigs} = (D_\nu\phi)^\dagger (D^\nu\phi) - V(\phi^\dagger \phi)
	\label{equation:higgsL}
\end{equation}
with the potential $V(\phi^\dagger \phi)$ being given by 
\begin{equation}
	V(\phi^\dagger \phi) = \mu^2\phi^\dagger \phi + |\lambda|(\phi^\dagger \phi)^2
\end{equation}
and the covariant derivative
\begin{equation}
	D_\nu = \partial_\nu - \frac{i}{2} g_wW_\nu^i \sigma_i - \frac{i}{2}g_YB_\nu
\end{equation}
Since $\mu^2<0$, this potential has the shape of a sombrero as is shown in Figure \ref{fig:higgspotential}.  The scalar fields have some positive vacuum expectation value (VEV) satisfying 
\begin{equation}
	\phi^\dagger \phi = v = \sqrt{-\frac{\mu^2}{\lambda}}
\end{equation}
at the minimum which allows us to write the ground state as
\begin{equation}
	\phi_{ground} = <0|\phi|0> = 
	\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
	\left(
	\begin{array}{c}
		0 \\
		v
	\end{array}
	\right)
\end{equation}
Expanding the Higgs field about it's minimum as 
\begin{equation}
	\phi_{ground} \rightarrow \phi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}e^{i\sigma_\alpha \theta^\alpha (x)}
	\left(
	\begin{array}{c}
		0 \\
		v + h(x)
	\end{array}
	\right), \alpha= 1,2,3
\end{equation}
results in a massive field $h(x)$ and and three massless scalar fields, or Goldstone bosons, $\theta_{1,2,3}$ which represent degrees of freedom.  By then transforming into the unitary gauge we can remove the phase factor, thereby eliminating the explicit appearance of the three Goldstone bosons in the Lagrangian.  In gauging away the Goldstone bosons, the three degrees of freedom reappear as longitudinal polarization states of the $W^+$, $W^-$, and $Z$ bosons.  In other words, the $W$ and $Z$ bosons have become massive by "eating" the Goldstone bosons.

Instead the stable vacuum state of nature is located somewhere along the circle of minimum potential. Reprint from \cite{Ellis:2011}}
	\label{fig:higgspotential}
\end{figure}


Writing the Lagrangian in Equation \ref{equation:higgsL} in terms of the physical $W$ and $Z$ fields and evaluating at the VEV gives 
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
	\mathcal{L}_{Higgs} = &\frac{1}{2}\partial_\nu h\partial^\nu h + \frac{1}{4}g_w^2W_\nu^+W^{-\nu}(v+h)^2 \\
	& + \frac{1}{8}\frac{g_w^2}{\cos^2\theta_W}Z_\nu Z^\nu (v+h)^2 - V[\frac{1}{2}(v+h)^2]
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
The $v^2$ terms give the $W$ and $Z$ boson masses and the $h^2$ term gives the mass of the Higgs boson as
\begin{eqnarray}
	M_W = \frac{1}{2}g_wv \\
	M_Z = \frac{1}{2}v\frac{g_w}{\cos\theta_W} = \frac{M_W}{\cos\theta_W} \\
	M_H = \sqrt{2}|\mu|
\end{eqnarray}
while the photon remains massless.

Charged leptons and quarks also acquire mass through Yukawa interactions via the Higgs mechanism.  For leptons the Yukawa interaction has the form of 
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L}_{Yukawa} = -G_e[\bar{e_R}\phi^\dagger\ell_L + \bar{\ell_L}\phi e_R]
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
	\ell_L = 
	\left(
	\begin{array}{c}
		\nu_{eL} \\
		e_L
	\end{array}
	\right)
\end{equation}
and $G_e$ is an arbitrary coupling parameter.  Note that this is the Yukawa term for the electron doublet.  The muon and tau doublets would have the same form.  Then using the unitary gauge version of $\phi$ we get 
\begin{eqnarray}
	\mathcal{L}_{Yukawa} = -\frac{G_e}{\sqrt{2}}(v + h)(\bar{e_L}e_R + \bar{e_R}e_L) \\
	= -\frac{G_ev}{\sqrt{2}}(\bar{e}e) -\frac{G_e}{\sqrt{2}}(h\bar{e}e)
\end{eqnarray}
where the electron mass is given by 
\begin{equation}
	m_e = \frac{G_ev}{\sqrt{2}}.
\end{equation}
Repeating the process for the second and third lepton generations gives the muon and tau masses as
\begin{equation}
	m_\mu = \frac{G_\mu v}{\sqrt{2}}, m_\tau = \frac{G_\tau v}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{equation}
Since there are no $\nu_R$ fields in the SM, neutrinos are not able to acquire mass the way charged leptons do.  

In order to generate quark masses for both the up and down-type quarks it's necessary to use $\phi$, which has $Y$ = 1, and the conjugate multiplet which is given by
\begin{equation}
	\tilde{\phi} = \left(
	\begin{array}{c}
	\phi^{0^*} \\
	-\phi^-
	\end{array}
	\right)
\end{equation}
and has $Y$ = -1.  The conjugate multiplet then, similar to $\phi$, breaks to 
\begin{equation}
	\tilde{\phi} \rightarrow \left(
	\begin{array}{c}
		v + h \\
		0
	\end{array}
	\right)
\end{equation}
The Yukawa term for the first generation quarks has the form
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L}_{Yukawa} = -G_d\bar{q_L}\phi d_R - G_u\bar{q_L}\tilde{\phi}u_R + h.c.
\end{equation}
where $G_d$ and $G_u$ are arbitrary coupling parameters and 
\begin{equation}
	q_L = \left(
	\begin{array}{c}
		u_L \\
		d_L
	\end{array}
	\right).
\end{equation}
Applying the broken $phi$ and $\tilde{\phi}$ gives us
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L}_{Yukawa} = -(m_d \bar{d}d + m_u\bar{u}u)(1 + \frac{h}{v})
\end{equation}
where the mass eigenstates are 
\begin{equation}
	m_q = \frac{G_qv}{\sqrt{2}}.
\end{equation}

It's worth noting that for each of these masses there is an arbitrary coupling parameter ($G_q$, $G_e$, $G_\mu$, and $G_\tau$).  This means that the values of the fermion masses are not predicted by SM, but these parameters are tuned to reflect observation.
%We can write the Lagrangian for the weak interaction as
%\begin{equation}
%	\mathcal{L}_{QED} = \bar{\psi}(i\gamma^\mu D_\mu -m)\psi - Tr\frac{1}{8}W_{\mu \nu}W^{\mu \nu}
%	\label{equation:qedlagrangian}
%\end{equation}


%Recall that there are three vector bosons ,$W_\mu^{1,2,3}$, associated with $SU(2)_L$ and one, $B_\mu$, associated with $U(1)_Y$.  

At this point we can summarize the particle content of the SM and their allowed interactions in a way that is seen in Figure \ref{fig:smcontent}.

It should be noted that neutrinos in the SM are still treated as massless leptons despite the fact that experimental evidence has established that at least two of the neutrinos are massive.

\section{Problems with the SM}
Though the SM has proven to be largely successful, there are still some limitations which must be addressed.  We can group these two categories.  The first of which is phenomena that have been observed experimentally yet are not explained by the SM.  The second is the question of why the SM requires a high degree of fine tuning of parameters to properly explain some phenomena.

\subsection{Missing from the SM}
The following is a description of some of the things that are missing from the SM.  This list is non-exhaustive but is meant to highlight the need for theories beyond the current scope of the SM in order to get a more complete understanding of all natural phenomena.

Perhaps the most noticeable omission in the SM is a description of the gravitational force.  While gravity is well understood over large distances by other means, attempts to construct a quantum theory of gravity have not been successful.  

Another issue is the lack of neutrino mass in the SM.  Neutrinos are left-handed without right-handed counterparts and therefore do not couple to the Higgs field which leaves them massless.  Experimental observations have shown that neutrinos undergo flavor oscillations which is only possible if they are massive.  The mechanism by which neutrinos gain their mass cannot be explained in the current framework of the SM.

The inability to explain the evidence of the presence of dark matter in the observable Universe is another shortcoming of the SM.  Studies of galactic rotation curves, the cosmic microwave background, and gravitational lensing, for example, indicate that dark matter comprises approximately 30\% of the energy density of the Universe is comprised of non-baryonic dark matter\cite{Darkmatter:2004pz}.  While there are a number of theories proposed that explain the existence of dark matter, there is currently no explanation in the SM.

\subsection{Fine tuning}
The issue of fine tuning revolves around the fact that there are at least 19 free parameters in the SM that are set by hand to seemingly unrelated and arbitrary values\cite{Ellis:2002wba}.  Having to tune these paramaters to have specific values in order to match observations is somewhat unsatisfying in a theoretical sense and begs the questions of whether there is some underlying mechanism that is causing them to take on these particular values.  The hierarchy problem is one such fine tuning issue which is related to the observed mass of the Higgs boson, measured to be 125 GeV by the CMS\cite{CMS:2012qbp} and ATLAS\cite{ATLAS:2012yve} experiments.  It's mass receives one-loop quantum corrections from all fermions which can be written as
\begin{equation}
	\Delta m_H^2 = -\frac{|\lambda_f|^2}{8\pi^2}\Lambda_{UV}^2 + ...
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_f$ is the Yukawa coupling and $\Lambda_{UV}$ is the ultraviolet cutoff which is energy up to which the SM is valid, which is taken to be at the Planck scale (10$^{19}$ GeV).  The quadratic dependence of the Higgs mass on $\Lambda_{UV}$ would make it much larger than the observed value.  Counter terms from all orders of perturbation theory would have to be extraordinarily precise and enormous in order to cancel the large corrections and keep the Higgs mass at its observed value.
