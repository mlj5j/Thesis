\chapter{CMS Particle and Event Reconstruction}
After an event is chosen to be stored by the trigger system, the output from all of the sub-detectors is saved and recorded to disk.  The particle flow (PF) algorithm performs the reconstruction of particles and event-level observables from this raw data which essentially consists of tracker hits and energy deposition in the calorimeters, also referred to as calorimeter clusters.  The basic idea is the to assign each hit in the tracker and each calorimeter cluster to final state particle.  This is essentially done using reconstructed tracks and calorimeter clusters while being mindful of the expected response of different particles in each sub-detector and how each particle should behave in the field produced by the magnet.
